\paragraph{}In Ancient Greece, to be a good citizen was to be virtuous. Truth was valued as a virtue, so good citizens were necessarily concerned with the truth.\footnote{Do you see what I did there? My syllogism: truth = virtue \& good citizen = virtue therefore good citizen = concerned with the truth? This is an example of the deductive reasoning used by Plato}
