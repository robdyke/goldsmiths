\f0\fs24 \cf0 In order for a term to be of use in describing a period it needs to accurately describe a period. My argument against 'consensus theory' is based on the limited utility of term. Yet 'consensus politics' continues to have currency, despite public floggings1, and the era in question continues to be examined. Would another term better describe the period 1951-70? My synthesis of some of the ideas and observations made in the 'consensus politics' debate follows and adds to the lexicon a new term: 'osmosis politics'.}
