	nation-state to function within the national interest. Hardt and
	Negri argue that nation-state sovereignty is in decline and that
	Empire --- a new supranational and deterritorialising form of sovereignty
	--- has superseded it. The question then arises, where does sovereignty
	reside if it is no longer existent within the nation-state. It is
	here that post-colonial theory may well provide insights as post-colonial
	subjects have had to confront these issues. The following questions
	are explored through a critical engagement with recent social theory.
	What is the relationship between the biological and political body
	within such a context? Furthermore, what are the implications of
	this for a politics of resistance?},

	world in which there exists no predetermined historical subject of

	and its supersession resides in the affinity between the normative
	values that shape Marx's reading of history and the emancipatory
	character of the multitude, which frames the notion of empire. Hardt

	with alternative ideological notions that inform more orthodox interpretations
	of globalization, and thereby points to the ideological character
	of theories of globalization.},

	communication and power relationships in the technological context
	that characterizes
	
	the network society. Based on a selected body of communication literature,

	number of case studies and examples, it argues that the media have
	become the
	
	social space where power is decided. It shows the direct link between
	politics, media
	
	politics, the politics of scandal, and the crisis of political legitimacy
	in a global
	
	perspective. It also puts forward the notion that the development
	of interactive,
	
	horizontal networks of communication has induced the rise of a new
	form of
	
	communication, mass self-communication, over the Internet and wireless
	
	communication networks. Under these conditions, insurgent politics
	and social
	
	movements are able to intervene more decisively in the new communication
	space.
	
	However, corporate media and mainstream politics have also invested
	in this new
	
	communication space. As a result of these processes, mass media and
	horizontal
	
	communication networks are converging. The net outcome of this evolution
	is a
	
	historical shift of the public sphere from the institutional realm
	to the new

	group of science and technology studies has set itself to tackle
	since the beginning of the 1980s (Callon, Law, Rip, 1986). However
	this theory has been often misunderstoond and hence much abused.
	I would like in this paper to list some of the interesting properties
	of networks and to explain some of the misunderstandings that have
	arisen. I will not concern myself here with the quantitative studies
	especially the so called 'co-word analysis' since they are themselves
	misunderstood because of the difficulty of exactly grasping the social
	theory and quaint ontology entailed by actor-network (but see Callon,
	Courtial, Lavergne 1989a,b).},

	work, without ignoring their more positive understandings of the
	topic. I hope to sustain three arguments about networked, digital
	information humachines that counter the dystopian thesis: (1) They
	are an evolving, unavoidable and central aspect of globalization;
	(2) they contain countless dangers and afford considerable resources
	for highly dangerous prevailing agglomerations of power; (3) they
	offer serious points of resistance to those powers and may serve
	as a base for developing auspicious, decentralized, multicultural
	global networks. These theses are mutually related, sustainable only
	together.},
