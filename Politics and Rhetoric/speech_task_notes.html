<p class="p1">more than a decade ago my party gave me their trust and elected me as leader. to lead them in developing and delivering new policy for the new challanges of the age. a decade ago, you the british people, gave me your trust, to lead this nation when you elected me prime minister. you gave endorsed me and gave my party a mandate to govern.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">government, it is said, is about delivering the possible. policy is what is possible. that's not my view of government. government policy is not what is possible, it is about what is made possible. our shared principles of social democratic justice have made the policy of this government possible. unity of values, strength in purpose. a government that makes things possible; an enabling state. now let me tell you what has been made possible over the last decade under my leadership.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">I said I would be tough on crime, tough on the causes on crime. And this had led to interventions in communities making a real difference, improving the quality of life for people, reducing crime, reducing disorder, reducing fear. returning to the british people the trust they placed in me.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">I said I would seek out poverty. My government has for the last decade delivered policy targeting poverty, lifting children out of deprivation, paying a decent minimum wage, ending degrading means testing. we have raised the general level of wealth and prosperity of the people of this nation, repaying the trust they placed in me</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">my leadership of this government has ensured we delivered on our commitments. Earning again and again, for second and then a historic third term, the trust of the british people.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">I make no apology for policy mandate endorsed by the great british people at general election. I make no apology for continuing to meet the challenges that we face today with policy based on my principles, endorsed by majority and giving me and this party government.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">policy is not developed from gazing in a crystal ball, nor a problems solved with a simple wave of a magic wand</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">policy has failed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">decade of delivery, deluge of disapprobation.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">my values have not changed. I do not see my party as having changed. while there is a cruel wind blowing, weakening the resolve of some in my own party in staying the course, I<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>have not led my party into a storm. modernisation is not an event, its a process and we must continue to renew and revive.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
