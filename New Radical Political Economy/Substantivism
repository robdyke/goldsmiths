Substantivism is associated with Karl Polanyi. Polanyi saw two dimensions to the term 'economics'.

In the first it refers to the rational decision-making and rational action concerning the use of scare resources.

The second substantive dimension in economics refers to the study of how humans make a living from their social and natural environment.

At the macro level then, a societies economic activity demonstrates how reason and scarcity are environmental and material.

Soros and Stiglitz as substantivists par excellence: they have both worked in and made money in the first; their later Keynesianism demonstrates the second.
